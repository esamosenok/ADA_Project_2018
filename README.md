# Title
__cs_team_beta_hw2__ Project

# Abstract
Our main goal is to explore Open Food Facts database, apply the knowledge of data analysis techniques and best practices acquired during attending Applied Data Analysis course at EPFL in Lausanne in Autumn 2018 and figure out meaninful/insighful relationships between different dimensions used to categorize the data or externals metrics.
This may sound as quite a generic description, but we would rather not to restrict ourselves on this stage and build the story gradually while improving our understand of the data.

# Research questions
1. There are lots of different dimensions which could be used to analyse/slice the data: dates when the product was added and last modified, produced country, brand, categories (e.g. snack, dessert), country / store where the product was purchased, size and weight of the product, amount of fat, sugar, vitamins, chemicals, ingredients as text etc
We will explore the dimensions above and relate some of those to each other or such generic metrics as country (producer or consumer) GDP, life expectancy (vitamins, salt, sugar, other chemicals), expore which country/store is the biggest produce/consumer of product by brand/ingredients etc.
2. Explore the quality of the data, find and estimate inconsistencies (e.g. accuracy of the text description)
3. Finally, there are images available for each product, so we will try to analyse those using Deep Learning techniques (CNN) and relate to some other deminsions avialable in the dataset.

# Dataset
Open Food Facts database contains information about. The dataset contains the data on food products from around the world. For each item, the database stores its generic name, quantity, type of packaging, brand, category, manufacturing or processing locations, countries and stores where the product is sold, list of ingredients, any traces.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
1. Try both Spark and Pandas and choose the better option
2. Explore the data (slice and dice) to have better ideas about what kind of detailed analysis we are mostly interested in
3. Ideally, we would like to try to apply Machine Learning to analyze the images (CNN) and relate the same to some results obtained by statistical analysis of the data. This is not exactly clear on this stage how/if this could be done, so the next step is to check the feasibility of the approach.
