      <h3>#Abstract</h3>
      <p>Our main goal is to explore Open Food Facts database, apply the knowledge of data analysis techniques and best practices acquired during attending Applied Data Analysis course at EPFL in Lausanne in Autumn 2018 and figure out meaninful/insighful relationships between different dimensions used to categorize the data or externals metrics.</p>
      <p>
This may sound as quite a generic description, but we would rather not to restrict ourselves on this stage and build the story gradually while improving our understand of the data.

      <h3># Research questions</h3>
      <p>1. There are lots of different dimensions/metrics which could be used to analyse/slice the data: dates when the product was added and last modified, produced country, brand, categories (e.g. snack, dessert), country / store where the product was purchased, size and weight of the product, amount of fat, sugar, vitamins, chemicals, ingredients as text etc
We will explore the dimensions/metrics above and relate some of those to each other or such generic metrics as country (producer or consumer) GDP, life expectancy (vitamins, salt, sugar, other chemicals), expore which country/store is the biggest produce/consumer of product by brand/ingredients etc. We will also check how some of the metrics evolve over time.</p>
<p>
2. Explore the quality of the data, find and estimate inconsistencies (e.g. accuracy of the text description)</p>
<p>
3. Finally, there are images available for each product, so we will try to analyse those using Deep Learning techniques (CNN) and relate to some of the deminsions avialable in the dataset.
